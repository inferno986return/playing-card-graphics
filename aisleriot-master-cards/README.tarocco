Based on my retouched scans of a card deck made by "Piatnik" around 1900
featuring the standard "Industrie und Gl√ºck" (B) tarock pattern.

This particular design version dates back to the 2nd half of the 19th century.

I opted for Italian index letters because the deck is/was also issued by
italian makers
